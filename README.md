## How to install vipergen ?
You can install it easily as using the gem. With ruby installed in your OSX execute:
```bash
sudo gem install vipergen
```
If everything were right, you should have now the vipergem command available in your system console

## How to generate a VIPER module with a given name?
You have just to execute the following command
```bash
vipergen generate MyFirstViperModule --path=~/myproject/shared
```
And then the files structure will be automatically created. Don't forget to add this folder to your project dragging it into the XCode/Appcode inspector

## Developer tips
### Update the gem 
When the gem is updated it has to be reported to the gem repository. I followed this tutorial http://amaras-tech.co.uk/article/43/Creating_executable_gems that basically says that once you have your gem ready execute:
```bash
gem build vipergen.gemspec
gem install vipergen-0.1.gem
gem push vipergen-0.1.gem
```
Then you'll be asked for your credentials in order to make the update in the repo (http://guides.rubygems.org/publishing/)

### Add a new template
Are you interested in VIPER and you would like to contribute with this gem adding new templates? Feel free to do it. It's pretty easy. You've just to:
- Create a folder inside `templates` with the name of your template
- You'll have to create inside the templates in both languages, Swift and Objective-C (get inspired from existing templates)
- Use the word VIPER where you want the name to be replaced in.
- Remember to add the file viperspec.yml with the description of your template as below:
```yaml
author: pepi
author_email: pepibumur@gmail.com
template_description: Default template with the simplest structure using VIPER
updated_at: 2014-08-24
```
- Report it as a PR in this repo updating the gem version in Gemspec.
